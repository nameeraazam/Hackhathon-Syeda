🔹 Key Milestones Achieved on Day 2:
1️⃣ Defining Technical Requirements 🛠️
A solid technical foundation is key to building a successful product. Today, I outlined:

🔹 Frontend Requirements:

Built using Next.js to provide an optimized, lightning-fast user experience for our furniture customers.
Ensured full responsiveness across devices for an enjoyable shopping experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
Essential pages include Homepage, Product Catalog, Product Details, Cart, Checkout, and Order Confirmation.
🔹 Backend & Database
(Sanity CMS):
Sanity CMS will power the backend, handling product data (e.g., furniture specifications, images, and pricing), customer information, and order management.
Defined and designed schemas in Sanity CMS to ensure smooth data management and alignment with business goals.
Set up efficient content management to allow for easy updates and dynamic product handling (e.g., new arrivals, promotions, and inventory updates).
🔹 Third-Party API Integrations:

Payment Gateway Integration (Stripe, PayPal, etc.) to facilitate secure transactions.
Shipment Tracking API to provide customers with real-time updates on their furniture deliveries.
2️⃣ Designing the System Architecture 🔍
A robust system architecture is the backbone of a successful platform. Here’s how the components interact:

📌 Frontend (Next.js):

The user-facing platform allows customers to browse furniture products, manage their cart, and complete purchases seamlessly.
📌 Sanity CMS:

The backend that powers the product catalog and handles order processing, stock updates, and customer data management.
📌 Third-Party APIs:

Integration with external services, including payment processing (e.g., Stripe) and shipment tracking.
📌 Data Flow:
1️⃣ The user interacts with the Next.js frontend, exploring the furniture collection.
2️⃣ The frontend fetches product data from Sanity CMS using API requests (including furniture descriptions, prices, and availability).
3️⃣ Order details are saved in Sanity CMS once a customer completes a purchase.
4️⃣ The Shipment Tracking API provides real-time delivery updates.
5️⃣ The Payment Gateway API ensures secure processing of payments.
6️⃣ Data synchronization between frontend, backend, and external APIs ensures smooth operations, from product selection to order tracking.

This strong architecture ensures the platform is scalable, efficient, and ready for a seamless user experience! 🔥

3️⃣ Planning API Requirements 🌐
A well-designed API structure is essential for seamless communication across the platform. Here are the key RESTful APIs I planned:

📌 GET /products → Retrieve a list of available furniture products from Sanity CMS, with filters for categories, styles, and price ranges.
📌 POST /orders → Create a new order, storing customer details, product selections, and payment status.
📌 GET /shipment → Retrieve real-time updates on the order's shipping and delivery status.

Each API is built for speed, security, and seamless data flow, ensuring a smooth shopping experience for our customers.

4️⃣ Designing Key Workflows 🔄
To ensure a smooth shopping experience, I planned out the following key workflows:

✅ User Registration:
User signs up → Data stored in Sanity CMS → Confirmation email sent to user with account details.

✅ Product Browsing:
User explores furniture products → Sanity CMS provides up-to-date product information (e.g., product details, price, and availability).

✅ Order Placement:
User adds items to cart → Proceeds to checkout → Order details saved in Sanity CMS and payment processed.

✅ Shipment Tracking:
Real-time order status updates are retrieved from the shipment tracking API and displayed to the customer.

Every step is carefully designed to enhance customer experience and streamline backend operations! 💡

📍 Key Insights from Today:
✅ Clear understanding of how the frontend, backend, and APIs communicate for seamless operation.
✅ A well-defined system architecture that facilitates efficient data flow and supports scalability.
✅ Thoughtfully structured API design and core workflows to support efficient product management, order fulfillment, and customer engagement.
✅ Emphasis on scalability, security, and efficiency in all aspects of technical planning.

This foundation will set us up for success as we move forward in building a seamless, high-performance furniture e-commerce platform! 🌟
